# Module 5 Lab 2

## Instructions:
Palindromes and anagrams. Whoohooo!

0. Create a script called `module5_lab2.py`.

0. Write a function that takes two strings and determines if they are anagrams. HINT: use a dictionary to count characters maybe. There are shorter ways to do this, but this one will flex our dictionary ninja foo!
