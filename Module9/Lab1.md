# Module 9 Lab 1

Classes are just different ways to organize the variables and functions you've already been writing. 
Think about them as containers for variables that the internal class functions should only be able to change

## Instructions:

0. Let's walk through `lab1.py` together and play with the classes to talk about the following things Summer was talking about in her lecture

0. How to instantiate a class

0. `__init__`. When it runs. What goes in it. 

0. `self`. What is it. What does it refer to

0. How to call functions on an instance.

0. Special functions in a class that you can "override" or use: `__str__`, `__repr__`, `__dict__`
