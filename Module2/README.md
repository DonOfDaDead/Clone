Download and try to run the script `module2_lab1.py`. Note that it doesn't run correctly:

```bash
$ python3 module2_lab1.py
  File "module2_lab1.py", line 4
    this nested list represents
              ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

Fix the bad comments sections that you can find. Rerun the script to see if you fixed it. When it runs it correctly
it should output the following table:

```bash
$ python3 module2_lab1.py
|Greg         |Corradini    |Minneapolis  |75432        |
|Summer       |Rae          |Seattle      |98110        |
```
