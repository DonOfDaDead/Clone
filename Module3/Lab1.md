## Module3 Lab1 -- Functions and Conditionals

# Instructions

0. Create a script called `module3_lab1.py` in your personal workspace

0. Write a function called `odd_or_even` that takes a single integer as an argument.

0. Inside the function write a loop that will iterate from 0 until the integer argument. Note: read about [.range()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq-range). 

0. For each integer in the for loop `print()` out if it is odd or even to the console.
