# Module3 Lab2:

## Instructions

0. Create a script called `module3_lab2.py` in your personal workspace

0. Write a function called `odd_or_even` that takes a single integer as an argument.

0. Inside the function write a loop that will iterate from 0 until the integer argument. Note: read about [.range()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq-range). 

0. For each integer in the for loop `print()` out if it is odd or even to the console.

0. Using `print()` seems not functional. Try returning a list of all odd-or-even answers. For example, the call input and output in the Python
interpreter might look like this:

	```bash
	In [1]: odd_or_even(3)
	Out[1]: [answer1, answer2, answer3]
	```
