# Github
Social code repository
- Open source code is usually posted up here
- You can download, edit, use, contribute
- Great for development teams
- Version control for your project
- Great to have your own project repo for prospective employers

## Repo Basics
Each github repo has a basic structure. 

We'll use the pandas module as an example:
https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas

- README.md - Create an introduction to your code, how to install, and how to use it.
- View the program languages included
- Star the page for easy return, like a bookmark
- Read a wiki for help on installing and using the program
- Watch the repo for changes/updates/bug fixes
- Get a link to clone or download the repo
- Issues - Read up on or report bugs
- Interactive code review
- Submit a pull request to add your own code to the repo

## Niceties
- [Github pages](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/): create a repo for your website
- [Github integrations](https://github.com/integrations): apps that enhance your gethub experience
- [Interactive Ipython Notebooks](http://mybinder.org/): run Jupyter Notebook live off of github
